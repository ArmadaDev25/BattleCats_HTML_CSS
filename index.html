        <p class="catDesText">
            Mikeshake is a whirlwind of fur and fury, a warrior kitten feared not for his size, but for his signature move—the Shake of Doom. Clad in a cape made 
            from a torn sock and eyes that gleam with untamed mischief, Mikeshake doesn’t just fight—he shakes. With a pounce and a purr that masks impending chaos, 
            he grabs hold of his enemies and thrashes them side to side in a blur of claws, fluff, and indignation. Goblins, ogres, even seasoned knights have found themselves 
            flung like rag dolls, dazed and disheveled, wondering how such a cute creature could cause such catastrophic shaking. Legends say if you hear a furious 
            jingling bell and feel the ground tremble slightly... Mikeshake is coming.

        <p class="catDesText">
            Bonkin’ Billy is no ordinary kitten—he’s a pint-sized powerhouse of pure bonk energy. With his scrappy fur, a dented thimble for a helmet, and an ironclad stare 
            that could melt the bravest knight’s resolve, Billy charges into battle on stubby paws, wielding his legendary Bonk Bat: a tiny club carved from ancient driftwood 
            and justice. He doesn't meow—he declares. With a single bound and a whirling swing, he bonks enemies square on the noggin, leaving them woozy, wondering what just 
            happened, and maybe a little impressed. Tales of his heroic bonkings echo across kingdoms, where even dragons whisper his name with caution: “That’s Bonkin’ Billy... hide your helmets.”

        <h1 class="catDesTitle">Wild Willy</h1>
        <!-- Description -->
        <p class="catDesText">
            Don’t let the name fool you—Wild Willy isn’t just wild by name, he’s wild by nature. A blur of claws, grit, and chaotic energy, 
            this scrappy warrior kitten hails from the untamed alleyways of Clawford, where he learned to fight before he could meow. 
            With a torn bandana around his neck and battle scars etched into his fur, Wild Willy darts through the battlefield like a 
            streak of living lightning. He fights dirty, fast, and fearlessly, using unpredictable moves like the Whisker Whip and the Tailspin 
            Takedown to leave foes reeling. No plan survives contact with Wild Willy—not even his own. He’s a one-kitten storm, and when the 
            dust settles, only the boldest dare stand where Wild Willy has passed.
